# algorithmic-complexity

This is the "Ruby" code for the testing how efficient programmes are and, in this initial case, timing code and the following library functions :

- last
- reverse
- shuffle
- sort (using 'shuffle' first so as not to bias the results, as per the course instructions).

I have attached some of my spreadsheet results and a chart plotting them.
